  "`attrs` may carry `:sealed` — an opaque map describing content this mailbox
  holds but cannot read (an encryption envelope and whatever the holder needs
  to open it). This model does not interpret it; it exists so that a sealed
  message can BE a message here.

  Without it the only way to store one was to fabricate an empty `message`,
  which is not a smaller truth than the real one but a different and false one:
  a reader cannot tell an empty message from one whose content is elsewhere.

  A sealed entry should pass `:size-bytes`, since `body-bytes` of a message
  with no parts is 0 and a mailbox that reports 0 bytes used is wrong rather
  than merely imprecise."
